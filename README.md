## Why We Exist
**Communities are hard.** Our mission is to be the most helpful partner in building startups through sustainable and value driving communities. To us community is a hard value. It takes deliberate effort, requires skills and knowledge. Yet it is probably one of the most valuable asset and strongest differentiators any startup can build today. While code and design can be copy-pasted, communities can't. When people hear the word community, they think of glorified customer support people. When we hear the word community, we think product.

**Communities are undervalued.** While there are funds, accelerators, etc. that focus on tech, design and many other vertical specific aspects few drive the evolution of community as a hard value. We are building a fund precisely because we think community is undervalued not just for what it can do in our societies, but also for return on investment.

**Communities superpower companies.** We want to give our portfolio companies and founders superpowers by being able to draw directly on the combined pool of skills and hard-earned experience of some of the most successful and meaningful communities in the world, and their networks of millions of people that have been built by our limited partners, advisors and wider community. 

**Tech can change the world.** We believe the world is a better place when people participate, cooperate and care. We see building Community Capital as a direct tool to accelerate what we value in the world and make a positive contribution to the communities that we all live in through building technology. 

**This is not a pay-check for us.** Bc we really care this is not just our job but our live - so we want to spend our time with people who we respect and inspire us. 

## Who We Are
**Community Capital is not your usual fund.** We are a decentralized network of people aligned around building sustainable and scaleable startups driven by meaningful communities. The core are the founders of our portfolio companies, leveraging the knowledge and expertise of our LPs, advisors and broader network representing some of the most successful startups like Airbnb, Kickstarter, Meetup.com, Soundcloud, Mapbox, and many others. The day to day orchestrating of the community is driven by two the partners of the fund.

**Our community is the fund.** Everyone always says that their fund has a strong community around it. We focus on building that community day in day out to drive value for everyone who is part of it. While our two partners are the ones building the infrastructure for the community and pushing it on a day to day basis, the community we’re building is stronger than any single individual and connects with each other online and offline on regular basis.

**The two partners.** 
- [Severin Matusek](https://twitter.com/severinmatusek) - Focuses on communication, storytelling and culture. He has been driving communities in startups for 10+years most significantly building EYEEM's community of +20M photographers. A philosopher by trade, passionate cyclist and photographer usually can be found spending time with his young daughter Frida.
- [Kristoffer Tjalve](https://twitter.com/tjalve) - Focuses on growth, tools and product. Kristoffer has been building communities his whole life but has an unusual thirst for data, digital tools and hacking things together to drive growth with whatever is in front of him. Most recently he has been working with +400 co-creators in getting Techfestival of the ground.

**Getting our hands dirty.** Hands on exploring what makes communities successful, what tools give them superpowers and allow them to do more and connecting community leaders with each other to learn & grow is what makes us wake up every day. These are some of the fruits of the work we do: 
- [State of Communities Report](http://co-matter.com/the-state-of-communities-2018-report/) - The annual guidebook to engage people. Filled with insights, data and best practices from the world’s most thriving communities. Insights from community leaders at Airbnb, Red Bull, Rapha, Sofar Sounds, Google, CNN, Zapier, Polaroid Originals, Depop & many others.
- [Community Leadership Summit](http://co-matter.com/summit/) - Bringing the founders and community leaders from diverse sectors together for an intense interactive day of connecting, sharing and learning how we can better bring people together. Past participant from: MakerDAO, LifeX, Space10, Backed.VC, Slush, gov.uk, Protein, Carlsberg, Sanofi, Polaroid Originals, Virgin, Amnesty International and many more.
- [The Community Podcast](http://co-matter.com/thecommunitypodcast/) - Monthly in-depth conversations with community pioneers from companies like Clue, Kickstarter, WeTransfer, Rapha, Working not Working and Ladies get Paid.
- Open Sessions - Monthly pop-up dinners and talks in cities across the world. Initiated in 2018 with talks at HyperIsland (Stockholm), Space10 (Copenhagen), Protein (London), IAM Weekend (Barcelona) and IXDS (Berlin).

## Community Capital In Practice

**We usually invest $10-15k** in startups up to Series B where we can add value with our expertise and that of our network. We know these are not big tickets, but in terms of time and attention we give to startups, we punch way above our weight class - and we are just getting started. This is a proof of concept fund, a fund to proof that it makes a difference to have 150+ strong community leaders as limited partners and advisors who want to support the next generation of community driven companies to affect change in our world by building better companies rather than surrendering to the omnipresent pessimism.

**Investment Focus.** *What does a community focused startup actually mean?* To us, it means ability to inspire and build the framework for people to connect, participate and contribute. The contributions range from financing (e.g. investment, pre-ordering, crowdfunding, ...), services (e.g. reporting bugs, on-boarding new users), content (e.g. reviews, articles, videos, posts), ideation (e.g. user research, new product development) to resources and skills (e.g. collaborative economy, access to cars, houses, coding skills, time). We also keep an eye on startups that are building the infrastructure for communities, namely tools that make it easier to start, grow and sustain a community.

**Stage.** We know it's hip to be a pre-seed investor nowadays but we focus on when our expertise and network is of most value. Some startups have the resources, skills and capacity to work on their community from day zero, others start by solving technical problems and the community becomes more important a little later, yet others have build a great thriving community but want to step up their game as they grow and look for someone to partner with. We are not dogmatic about the stage of a company but make no compromise on the level of ambition, values and the ability to inspire change in millions of people through their products. 

**What to expect?** We are lucky to have a great community of limited partners ranging from founders, designer, to authors and ecosystem-builders. Everyone of our limited partners has committed to help the startups in our portfolio hands on and open their networks. This is also true for our advisors. As a portfolio company you have access to our network, knowledge-base, dinners we do across different cities from time to time, events just for our communities to meet up and either a couch or desk across many big cities. 
If you like how we approach the world ping us on twitter, write someone in our network that you are connected to or just drop us a line. We try to answer all our emails but sometimes things get lost between the cracks, dont disappear just keep pinging us.
  
## Our Core Values
- We are not a traditional investor, we are your partner in crime and prefer to get our hands dirty.
- We don't invest in any company where we would not answer a call from the founders at 3am.
- We are optimistic about technology and its ability to foster meaningful connections.
- We value building with and for diversity of ideas, culture, gender, race, and all our many differences.
- We aim to support the creation of successful companies, that create value for their customers, employees and partners, not good looking quarterly revenue reports and empty metrics.
- We believe that the impact and ability to foster change of community leaders far exceeds that of managers.

## Our Investment Process
We come to decisions fast and don't f*%$ around with anyone's time. It's important for us to meet the founders and the key people who are driving story, community and culture in the company to understand the vision but also the reality on the ground. This doesn't mean everything needs to be perfect we just want to understand where you really are at. These conversations can be short  but we found that we can help most if we understand who gets these things done internally and if and how we can contribute. Having at least one solid conversation is important to us since we are not primarily financial investors but are trying to build up a tribe of people who help, challenge and inspires each other. Understanding if we are on the same page about this is key to us. 
We are happy to connect you with people in our community to get references on us and understand how others see what value we can contribute. This is a great way to get to know our community to get started with our decentralized community driven approach from day zero.  

## Our Investment Decision Framework
- **Community** - Does community play a key role in the product and growth strategy in the startup?
- **Product** - Tech as enabler to connect people — Does the product have the power to affect the lives of millions of people?
- **Team** - Beside all the obvious questions whether the team is passionate, hungry, humble, empathetic, gets sh*$ done without turning into maniacs and hard working what's key to us is: Does the leadership in a startup own the responsibility over community, story & culture or have these topics be relegated to junior employees? Is there a founder community fit?
- **Contribute** - Are the founders willing to at least contribute as much to our community as they aim to take from it?
- **Diversity** - We know we are all not perfect but we need to see that a company are pushing for and is dedicated to diversity of ideas, gender, culture and race in their teams and community.

## Things We DONT Do

- **We don’t run your community**, you'll need to build and run that yourself. Instead we and our network is going to be your best friends when in need of advise and support about community - also during hard decisions.
- We don't pretend that we have anyway near as much skin in the game as you, kudos for pushing the world to become better!
- We don't beat around the bush and value straight forward feedback, also when it might be hard to hear. Please do the same in return!

## Where are we based
We dont have a huge office like most other funds but we travel between Berlin, Copenhagen, London and New York most of the time. Our home are co-working spaces and the offices of the people & companies in Community Capital. This allows us to be present at a much deeper level, providing support over the actual water-cooler. Ultimately we believe you can't build a community from your ivory tower, it requires you to get down on the ground and get your hands dirty. It's quite a lot of fun. It stimulates us, it challenges us and connects us with our community in a very real way.
